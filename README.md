# SU_DET_Project
Project SAFE is a sensory aligned VR experience intended for
relaxation and an escape from reality. The project is created in
Unity and allows the user, with an Oculus Quest headset, to
immerse themselves into a forest. Senses that are aligned
between the virtual and real-world include vision, sound,
touch, and smell
